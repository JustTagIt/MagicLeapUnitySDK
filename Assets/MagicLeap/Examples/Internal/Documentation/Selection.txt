# Example Scene: Selection

This example scene demonstrates and prescribes preferred methods for combining
physical world raycast with virtual raycast, as well as interacting with
virtual objects when the raycast hits.

The ray is emitted from the correct position that intersects both the physical
world and virtual objects. When a virtual object is hit, the object changes
colors.

## Bumper/Move
Press the Bumper to cycle raycast modes: controller, head, and eyes.

## Trigger/App
When you squeeze the trigger, an expanding visual effect is activated if the
ray is pointed at a virtual object.
